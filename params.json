{"name":"Weebly","tagline":"(Unofficial) Makes Weebly theme development easier","body":"Sometimes, Weebly is a nice option to use for client websites when you simply\r\nwant to get something done quickly, or for situations in which you want to\r\nallow your client to easily edit their site.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Weebly's developer experience is quite poor, and has many odd\r\nand strange requirements.  This simple gem allows you to develop your theme\r\nin a sane and (mostly) trouble-free environment.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```\r\n$ gem install weebly\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Referencing resources\r\nWhen referencing resources in your site (eg: `href`, `src` attributes), you\r\n*cannot include the full path!* Instead, simply include the file name, and\r\nit will be found when the site is built.  For this reason, you will want to\r\ntest your site by running `weebly server`, and not opening your files directly\r\nin a browser.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Wrong.  Do not do this! -->\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/master.css\">\r\n\r\n<!-- Correct.  Please do this instead. -->\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"master.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\n#### `weebly new <sitename>`\r\nWill create a new site in the current directory with the name `sitename`.\r\nThis site will include a basic directory structure, with places for CSS, JS,\r\nHTML layouts, and images.\r\n\r\n#### `weebly build`\r\nWhen run from a directory containing a site (eg: `sites/hello`, where `hello`\r\nis the Weebly site`), this command will validate, clean up, and compress your\r\nsite to be Weebly-ready.\r\n\r\n#### `weebly validate`\r\nWill validate your site to ensure that it conforms to Weebly's standards.  \r\n(Searches for template tags, directory structure, etc.)\r\n\r\n#### `weebly server`\r\nWill run your site on a local webserver (defaults to `localhost:8000`) and\r\nemulate the Weebly environment.  Note: *simply opening `index.html` in your\r\nweb browser is not good practice, and will not even work in this case.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
